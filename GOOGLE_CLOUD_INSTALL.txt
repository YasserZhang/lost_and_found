SETUP google cloud: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/quickstart#quickstart-analyze-entities-gcloud
1. Set up a GCP Console project.
    Click to:

        Create or select a project.
        Enable the Cloud Natural Language API for that project.
        Create a service account.
        Download a private key as JSON.

2. Install and initialize the Cloud SDK.

3. Provide authentication credentials to your application code by running the following command. 
        Replace [PATH] with the location of the JSON file that contains your credentials.
code:

gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file= C:\Users\flyin\Downloads\predict-sentiment-analysis-2344cecc6375.json



PROBLEM: Google Cloud Shell is using project=cloud-devshell-dev instead of my actual project, can't find enabled APIs

Create a service account and have your application use it for API access, run:

  $ gcloud iam service-accounts create my-account
  $ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json --iam-account=my-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=key.json

In the second command replace my-project with your Project ID.
